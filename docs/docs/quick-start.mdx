## Installation

Flume can be installed from npm like so:

```bash
npm install flume
```

or alternatively

```bash
yarn add flume
```

## Basic Usage

To get started, import and render the node editor like so:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { NodeEditor } from "flume";

const App = () => {

  return (
    <NodeEditor />
  )
}
```

As you may guess, this alone will render only a blank editor grid with no nodes.
